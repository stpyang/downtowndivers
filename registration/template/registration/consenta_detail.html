    I, the above named member of Katrina Dive Club (hereafter referred to as the “Club”), hereby affirm that the above stated inconsent.tion is true and accurate. I am an experienced certified diver. I know and completely understand the inherent hazards of scuba diving and using compressed gases or any other substance underwater and acknowledge that diving can result in serious injury or death. Specifically, I know and have been completely inconsent.d that using or mixing compressed air, oxygen, helium, argon, or gas mixes of Nitrox, Trimix, Helitrox, Normoxic Trimix or other hyperoxic mixtures greater than 40% oxygen content (including pure 2 oxygen)(hereinafter referred to as “Compressed Breathing Gases”), may predispose me or cause certain hyperbaric problems, squeeze, vertigo, arterial gas embolism, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity, decompression sickness, compression pains, and other hyperbaric problems or injury. I am aware that hyperbaric injuries require treatment in a recompression chamber facility and that diving activities may occur in a location that is remote, either by time or distance or both, from a recompression chamber. Notwithstanding, I still choose to participate in diving activities using compressed breathing gases underwater despite the possible absence of a recompression chamber in proximity to the dive site. I voluntarily and knowingly assume these risks.

    I understand and acknowledge that the Club is a non-profit, unaffiliated association of experienced divers who participate in technical and recreational scuba diving activities. A member of the Club shall be defined as any person who uses the Club’s services or facilities for any purpose related to or necessitating the completion of this Agreement in connection with the diving activities described herein. The Club provides its members with equipment support and services, including filling diving cylinders and scuba tanks (collectively, “Diving Cylinders”) with Compressed Breathing Gases. I acknowledge that the Club and its individual members are not certified by any licensing or professional authority or governmental agency to fill Diving Cylinders or to mix gases for use in Diving Cylinders and neither the Club nor any member has made any such representations or promises to me. I further acknowledge that if I fill my Diving Cylinders personally or have them filled by any member of the Club, I do so at my own risk and subject to this Agreement. I represent I will use Diving Cylinders filled by the Club for personal use only and solely for technical and/or recreational diving. I acknowledge that the safe storage and use of Compressed Breathing Gases for such purposes is the responsibility of all Club members, jointly and individually. I agree and represent I will strictly adhere to all safety requirements when filling my Diving Cylinders as set forth in this Agreement. I understand that I am solely responsible for the proper and safe inspection, maintenance, filling and use of my Diving Cylinders and I voluntarily and knowingly assume these obligations and any and all risks arising out of or related to filling my cylinders with Compressed Breathing Gases.

    I understand and acknowledge that breathing industrial compressed air and/or Compressed Breathing Gases can be lethal due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, possible impurities in it or the manner in which such air or gases are filled in Diving Cylinders. Specifically I understand and am completely advised of the following:
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>special precautions need to be taken with gases other than air;</p></li>
    <li><p>oxygen in high concentrations is a major cause of fire and rust;</p></li>
    <li><p>oxygen should be very carefully stored in cylinders that are certified and labeled for oxygen use;</p></li>
    <li><p>oxygen and other gases must be carefully transferred from one cylinder to another;</p></li>
    <li><p>gas mixtures containing proportions of oxygen other than 21% could be extremely dangerous to divers;</p></li>
    <li><p>all cylinders must be labeled with their composition after filling;</p></li>
    <li><p>contaminated air or gases (eg., carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oil and lubricants from the compressor) at depth can be fatal;</p></li>
    <li><p>the blast caused by a sudden release of the gas pressure inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous;</p></li>
    <li><p>the greatest risk of explosion exists at the time the cylinders are being filled;</p></li>
    <li><p>keeping the cylinder slightly pressurized at all times reduces the possibility of contaminating the inside of the cylinder with corrosive agents, such as salt water, or toxic material, including but not limited to other substances, such as oils, poisonous gases, fungi or bacteria;</p></li>
    <li><p>use of Diving Cylinders containing improperly blended or incorrect proportions of Compressed Breathing Gases may be considered an ultrahazardous activity and could result in serious injury or death.</p></li>

I represent that I will only use Compressed Breathing Gases that are intended for my use and certification level and will not use Compressed Breathing Gases intended for use by divers with higher certification levels than I have. (For example, a helium mixture could not be used by a diver certified as a Nitrox Diver). I understand that it is solely my responsibility to ensure that the Diving Cylinders filled on the Club’s premises contain the proper Compressed Breathing Gases for my use and that the Club, its members and the Released Parties and Persons, jointly or individually, have no legal responsibility whatsoever to insure or certify that my Diving Cylinders are filled with the correct mix of Compressed Breathing Gases for my use or that the cylinders are safe or that the Compressed Breathing Gases are certified to be pure or of a quality approved by the Compressed Gas Association or the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers. I understand the inherent dangers of improperly filled Diving Cylinders and I assume all the risks thereof.
